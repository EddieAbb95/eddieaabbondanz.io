      <description>Where I&amp;rsquo;ve Been, and Where I&amp;rsquo;m Heading I took somewhat of an unplanned hiatus from working on No Mans Blocks. Initially, I took a break because I wanted to pursue writing a server for a Reddit clone. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until about two months in that I realized just how over scoped the project was and how long it would take to finish. While I may not have much to show for this time, it did open my eyes up to some of the common software-architecture patterns, and how to utilize these patterns to better organize my projects.</description>

      <description>Creating Time (literally!) I have a knack for forgetting what I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to accomplish on the game during the week. To try to overcome this so I have updates I can post on it, I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing down each accomplishment on a sticky note.
Every Friday I hope to write a small blurb, and post some code showing off the current state of No Mans Blocks. While the networking implementation is still early, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get a sever-authoratative set up running that handles syncing up lobby of players together.</description>

      <description>Playing Around at the Bit Level This weeks adventure has been exploring object serialization. Initially I was using the serializable attribute to convert my objects into byte arrays but for some objects such as the voxel chunks this is far from ideal. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to handle serialization with 2 different methods I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to bite the bullet and roll my own set up.
To help prepare for this task I&amp;rsquo;ve created a BitManipulator class that allows for individual bits to be written to in a byte array.</description>

      <description>Building Up the Network Logic While this week may not have much to show for it has built a solid foundation for networking. I spent some time refactoring the pre-existing network logic to try to clean things up. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t like how the NetServerManager and NetClientManager derived from a base class of NetManager that had a NetMessageProcessor component. It was gross having to call that and subscribe to it&amp;rsquo;s message events.</description>

      <description>Stepping back into Networking These past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a tangent that wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly planned. Diving head first into networking code, and attempting to refactor the voxel engine to support it really burnt me out. During this break I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on the core voxel engine itself. I decided to take the time to really spruce up the voxel engine and add in some much needed features. While I can&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember every change some of the key ones are:</description>
