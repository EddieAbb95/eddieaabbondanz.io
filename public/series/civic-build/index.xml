      <description>Ten months of work finally pays off I enjoy working on my own vehicles but by far the best part is finishing up. While it took longer than I hoped, and the deadlines I kept setting for myself came and went I can say it was worth the wait. Today was the second day of driving, and started off with topping off the tank. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t been gassed up since last September and was pretty much on E.</description>

      <description>Getting ready for the test drive While the car may not be on the road yet, it&amp;rsquo;s come quite a bit closer to getting there. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me. One of the things I didn&amp;rsquo;t do quite right was the clutch pedal pin. Since the car was an automatic initially, I had to source out some parts for the swap. I ended up buying just a generic pin for the clutch master cylinder to hook it to the clutch pedal.</description>

      <description>Finishing things up With the weather warming up it&amp;rsquo;s been making me miss the civic quite a bit. While it may not be the fastest car out there I do enjoy riving it. I had the chance to work on it a bit more this weekend. To get myself motivated I started by getting the radiator mounted in place. After that I wired up the charge harness.
I had thought this task would be difficult but it really wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad.</description>

      <description>Connecting the Pieces It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget just how many parts you&amp;rsquo;ve removed until it comes time to put them all back together. I know I&amp;rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now. In the end you always tell yourself never again yet it keeps happening&amp;hellip;
To help keep costs down I try to buy cheap things when I know they&amp;rsquo;ll only be used temporarily.</description>

      <description>Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&amp;rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.
Last year everytime I pushed the clutch in it made a real nice squeek that let everyone in a 15 foot radius know what was going on. Thankfully this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t forget to grease the pivot point on the clutch fork.</description>

      <description>Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to do a B18 swap however so I managed to sell off the engine (for stupid cheap&amp;hellip;). Here&amp;rsquo;s how it looked before touching it at all.</description>

      <description>New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that. My Dad helped out and welded in the new transmission bracket though. It came out pretty awesome and should (hopefully) have no problem mounting up the B swap.
I remembered I had some left over 3m vinyl wrap sitting in the basement and decided to try something different.</description>

      <description>Wrapping it up It&amp;rsquo;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.
Initially I wanted to work on finishing up the engine bay but with how cold it was outside I decided to focus on the motor instead.</description>

      <description>I like projects And I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of person that can&amp;rsquo;t leave a car alone. My civic is a 1993 DX hatch that I picked up off a friend of a friend 3 years ago. When I first bought it, it was an automatic and 100% stock. Cut to today and it&amp;rsquo;s totally different, it&amp;rsquo;s gone through rust repair, a paint job, and currently another motor swap. If your interested in it&amp;rsquo;s full history check out my build thread on D-Series.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back at college it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to make progress on the Civic. I do have a slight update to drop as the hood is just about done now.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fan of the stock antenna and it was broken so I figured we should delete it. My Dad helped out by soldering in a small patch to cover the antenna hole then skim coated it with body filler until you couldn&amp;rsquo;t even tell it was ever there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy working on the Civic in the past month. I&amp;rsquo;m verfy excited to shared the journey I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on, and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how the finished product looks.
Like every other civic / older Honda out there the wiper arms had basically all but lost their OEM paint. I wanted to fix them up so instead of buying new ones I sandblasted and powder coated mine with a nice matte black powder coat.</description>

      <description>The transmission in the Civic was a good deal for the price of $100, but it had a nasty grind anytime you shifted into 3rd gear above 3k RPM. Because of this, and a transmission popping up for sale for $75 bucks I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist making the switch.
While it was kinda gross, it actually cleaned up pretty nicely. After a lot of scrubbing and cleaning it was finally ready for paint.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&amp;rsquo;s a fact.
My first car was a 1999 Acura RL that I purchased from my Grandmother. The car was in rough shape, and needed some love but it was an amazing first car. I put over 36k miles on the car in 3 years, and loved everything about it.</description>
