I'm still fairly new to the Node.js universe, but it's quickly grown to be my favorite server environment. For awhile I had a disposition towards dynamic type languages like Javascript or Python because to me it just didn't feel "right". It's hard to explain, but after spending so much time in C#, or Java I guess I just didn't understand the benefits. Why would someone want to work in such a high level language? Wouldn't they want the high speed performance of a compiled language? Or the security of static types to prevent anything wonky from happening?

It wasn't until I spent some time working in the Node.js world that things finally started to click. It started about six months ago when I somehow convinced myself I could build a Reddit clone within a month (hint: I failed). I had no real experience building a back-end, nor front-end but I figured I knew C# and I could at least work in the realm of ASP.NET which I was (somewhat) familiar with. The three months I spent working on the project could be summed up in one simple picture:

Json web tokens, HTTP requests / responses, and everything else really threw me for a loop. It seemed the only thing I was really good at was creating 500 internal server errors. But I kept at it and the strange jargon slowly turned into concepts I could comprehend. Something I noticed along the way though, was every time I was researching a new concept I'd always stumble upon some mention of an npm package that provided what I was looking for. Why was Node.js so much better than ASP.NET, and why were there so many more packages? 

I don't know what finally tipped the scale, but I took the plunge and left behind my static typing security blanket. Honestly, I'm pretty happy I made the transition. I did end up jumping on the TypeScript bandwagon (old habits die hard I suppose), but it still offers some of the monkey-patching capabilities of JavaScript. I'd estimate the jump to Node.js set me back about two months but I did manage to develop a [user account API for a game](https://github.com/EddieAbbondanzio/UserAccountAPI) even though it may not have been my initial goal. 

This brings us to the present where I'm back at the point of confusion as I learn to master the behemoth known as Angular 7. Someday I aspire to become a full-stack developer, although I imagine by the time I feel comfortable making that claim the term will have been degraded to the point of being nothing more than buzz-words used in a job posting. I can dream though, and maybe one day I'll feel comfortable with my capabilities as a full-stack dev, but for now I can't think of a better way to describe my capabilities than this:
