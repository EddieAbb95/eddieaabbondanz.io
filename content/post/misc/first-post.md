Welcome!
---

If your reading this, it means you've found my new website. It's still in it's early stages so it may seem quite
primitive. It's powered via Hugo, and while I may have a decent grasp of HTML/CSS/JS, Go is a whole new concept.

In the following weeks I'll work on dialing things in and at the same time post progresss about my various projects
I'm working on.

What is this blog about?

Posts will mainly focus on topics related to game development. I'm currently working on a voxel engine
for my capstone project, and will be posting weekly updates regarding it's progress. Other topics may include
my project car, or smaller side projects I work on.

Who am I?

My name is Eddie Abbondanzio, and I am a college student who is in their last semester of college. My two
main hobbies are software development, and automotive work. I love anything hands on and come up with some
interesting ideas occasionally.
