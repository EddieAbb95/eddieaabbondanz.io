I like to joke and say that anyone else would have sent my Cherokee to the junkyard. 

Somedays if I'm in a sour mood from working on it, I'll joke and say that anyone **smart** would have sent my Cherokee to the junkyard.

My Cherokee is rusty, has a laundry list of issues, gets 17 MPG on the good days, and is literally a brick on wheels. But I love it.

Since May I've been spending the majority of my free time trying to fix it up. I did a full tear down restoration on the front axle which involved removing it from the vehicle, sandblasting it, painting it, and then replacing everything on it with brand new components.

From there I moved on to replacing every gasket on the engine, new oil pan, resprayed the valve cover, new timing chain, new starter, new alternator (mine was siezed!), and more. 

After that I pulled the dash and replaced the leaky ac evaporator, and the clogged up heater core. I even splurged and bought a new dash top since mine was cracked and brittle.

With all that work done I figured the Jeep was ready to go for another winter. But, upon inspecting the rear I realized the rust I had been ignoring for several years had reached the point where I could no longer pretend it didn't exist.

The rust had ate through the frame in a couple spots, and left other components with questionable structural integrity. I knew it wouldn't pass the annual state inspection it was due for in January.

With my only other vehicle being a summer car, I figured I may as well bite the bullet now and dig into it before I lose my second set of wheels. 

# Assessing the Damage

By far the least enjoyable part of any rust repair job, is assessing the damage. As you dig further and further into your beloved vehicle, you hope with each part that's removed it'll be the last one. But it never is. 

My Jeep came from the factory with the tow package that included a tow hitch reciever, and gas tank skid plate. The reciever was rusted out by the time I took ownership of the Jeep, but I did occasionally use it to haul around a small utility trailer.

Those rust flakes on the floor are from me hammering away on the hitch trying to remove it. I failed. The rust holes were not nearly as large prior to me going ham on it.

With the hitch out of the way I decided to remove the rear bumper. I had no idea the passenger quarter panel behind the bumper was so rusted out.

The driver side quarter panel looked better from the outside, but when peeked at from the inside it looked as if it was about ready to crumble apart.

At this point I put the Jeep on jack stands and removed the rear wheels. I needed to see how the frame looked.

That large rust hole is where the bump stop used to be. Looks like the bump stops stopped stopping bumps a long time ago.

Driver side is a little better by the non-existant bump stop.

The frame on the driver side was actually soft where the fuel neck passes through it. I gave it a good love tap with the 2.5lb sledge and instead of a solid clang it emitted a soft thump.

The slowly growing pile of rust and junk parts. I plan on fixing the gas tank skid plate down the road.

I ended up dropping the gas tank since the tank was going to be in the way of some of the rust repair. I also didn't feel that comfortable with the idea of welding close to it. The straps holding it in had seen better days

With the rust looking worse, and worse I had no choice but to pull the rear interior. I needed to see what the floor looked like.
![](images/13.jpg)

The passenger side floor wasn't terrible with only one rusted through spot directly above the frame.
![](images/14.jpg)

The driver side didn't look terrible either. 

But wait, what's that rust in the corner of the wheel well?
![](images/15.jpg)
![](images/16.jpg)

That's not good. Guess the floor is coming out too now.

With the gas tank out, and the rear suspension disconnected there was plenty of room. Don't mind my preemptive angle grinder cuts. 
![](images/17.jpg)

Lots of rust on the floor and frame where the abs sensors pass through underneath the rear seat.
![](images/18.jpg)

The driver frame rail had several holes by the fuel neck passage hole.
![](images/19.jpg)

Passenger side actually wasn't that bad. Still toast though.
![](images/20.jpg)

Things weren't looking good at this point. I realized I'd need to replace both frame rails, the floor, the shock crossmember, and the rear crossmember if I wanted to fix it properly. 

The rust was actually so bad I had a hard time figuring out where to start the repairs. After about an hour or so of internal debates I decided to start with replacing the rear crossmember below the hatch.

# Replacing the Rear Crossmember

The crossmember was still structurally sound (for now) but the rust was getting severe. I had thoughts about sand blasting it and painting it, but with the metal only being 16ga (1/16") I didn't think there was enough good metal left to go that route.

My second idea was to buy an OEM replacement but it turns out Chrysler discontinued it...

That left no other option but to make a custom one. I've never done any serious fabrication till now but I was convinced it'd be "easy" since it was so straight. Full of confidence and ignorance I ordered a 11ga (1/8") 2x6 steel tube that was 72" long.

While waiting for the 2x6 to arrive, I drilled out all the spot welds to get the rusted out one free.

You never realize how thin cars are till you start removing pieces.

The crossmember removed. It's missing part of its ends since I had to cut them off to free the crossmember. There's a couple spot welds behind where the tail lights sit that are impossible to reach with a standard drill.
![](images/24.jpg)

A few days later my 2x6 arrived. I was pretty excited to get started and forgot to take a picture of it prior to any cuts.
![](images/25.jpg)

Then several more cuts later it was starting to take shape.

About 40 hours of work and many mistakes later I had a new crossmember that somewhat resembled the original one.

Test fitted in place. It felt amazing to get the crossmember to the point where it would fit into the Jeep.

I painted her up with SPI epoxy primer.

And 6 spot welds later, she was reinstalled.

I was beginning to feel like I actually may be able to fix this heap.
