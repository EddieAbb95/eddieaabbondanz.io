I've been fairly quiet since I've just been enjoying the car. I've moved up North for college and have decided to sell the RL. There's nothing wrong with it I'm just bored of it. I really want something that can be modded a little more. There's almost no aftermarket support for the RL so everything has to be done custom.

It took a month to sell but this is the last pic of it. The new owner showed up in a nicely modded Prelude.
