In 2002 the RL came with clear corner tail lights. I've been envious of the since my 1999 features amber corners but tail lights on Ebay are too expensive.

I decided to cut open my tail lights and remove the amber manually. I also made custom sequential blinkers with Cree LEDs that are bright as hell.

I really like how they came out. I'm a huge fan of the minimalistic look and the tail lights paired with the debadge of the "Acura" logo looks nice.
