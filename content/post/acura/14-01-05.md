I decided to re add the defusers over the blinkers. It looks better in my opinion and feels more OEM.

Ran into a slight set back. The caps on the back of the headlights are too shallow and will need some modifications. My desk is a mess right now.

I made some cuts with a dremel and then used the heat gun to reshape the cap to give more clearance.

Using JB Weld I recreated the missing plastic.

A couple coats of paint later and they look normal again.
