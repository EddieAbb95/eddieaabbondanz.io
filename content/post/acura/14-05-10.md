With a stock exhaust the car was fairly quiet. I decided it was time to let the 3.5 V6 under the hood make some noise and ordered a Borla exhaust.

Lou's Exhaust in Portland did the install job. He even made some custom tips for it. I really like how it's tucked up nice and high and can't be seen.

Overall it sounds nice albeit a little loud.
