## Trying to find the size of a missing bolt?

I'm in the middle of swapping a B20B into my 1993 civic, and I had to buy (just about) every bolt / nut on the engine and transmission since I was missing so many. I also had the pleasure of tracking down all this information from various forums and sources. To try to help any others who are partaking in a similar project I've compiled a list of what I found below. I apologize if there are any errors, these specs are for a B20B with a B18B1 (ls) intake so in theory it should cover most B-Series stuff. It also applies to some D-Series stuff (throttle body, etc).

How to read the info:

-   The number in parenthesis is the quantity.
-   M8, M10, etc are the size of the bolt / washer / nut.
-   The middle number (1.00, 1.25, etc) is the thread pitch.
-   The last number is the length of the bolt.
