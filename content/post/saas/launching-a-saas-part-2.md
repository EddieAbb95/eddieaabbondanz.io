# Overview

This is the second part of my blog series about launching a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. I intend for this series to be a collection of the lessons I've learnt along the way, and is meant to be an educational experience. Because learning new things is one of my motivations there will be times where I explore DIYing portions of the project that should typically be offloaded to a third-party.

The Back End
=== 

For those unfamiliar with web development, a (dynamic) website, or web app is typically divided into two parts: front end, and back end. The front end can be though of as everything that the client runs, and sees. There's numerous front end frameworks out there but in the end they always boil down to the same three things: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is what web pages are comprised of, and CSS is the makeup that pretties them up. Ever see a (warning vulgar language) [website without CSS?](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) Probably not, at least not recently.

The back end on the other hand, is everything that runs on the server. This is where the brunt of the logic is located, and where sensitive data is stored. RESTless back ends have been all the craze lately





To prevent from re-inventing the wheel, several popular npm modules are used. They are as follows:

mysql
nodemailer
bcryptjs
jsonwebtoken
express
reflect
