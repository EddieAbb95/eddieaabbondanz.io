# Overview

This is the third part of my blog series about launching a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. I intend for this series to be a collection of the lessons I've learnt along the way, and is meant to be an educational experience. Because learning new things is one of my motivations there will be times where I explore DIYing portions of the project that should typically be offloaded to a third-party.

## Finding the First User

Launching my vehicle maintenance logging SaaS business has been quite the challenge. I've learnt a lot along the way though and I finally have something to show off for all of my hard work. It's taken me 3 months to reach this point, and I've been working on whenever time permits. I reckon I spend about 20-30 hours a week working on it, in any spare time I have left before / after my full time job.

I knew finding my first user would be a real challenge, but I never expected it to be this difficult. If anything, it's made the development portion of the process look easy. It feels demotivating, and makes me want to second guess my idea, but I'm not ready to throw in the towel yet.
