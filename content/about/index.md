# Who Am I?

![](images/me.jpg)

Welcome! My name's Eddie Abbondanzio, and this is my personal blog. I'm a software developer who loves to work on his own projects whenever possible. I graduated from the University of Maine in Orono in 2018 with a BS in Computer Science. I'm currently self-employed as an automotive detailer and run my own business: <a href="https://edsautodetailing.com">Ed's Auto Detailing</a>. Blog posts will cover anything from software architecture, design patterns, web development, and occasionally updates from working on my cars.

## Hobbies

- Anything automotive (detailing, restoration, mods, etc..)
- Software development (front-end, back-end, you name it).
- Running
- Cooking
- Long walks on the beach... Oh woops, wrong site.

## Projects

I always have several projects in progress. I like staying busy, and seeing what I can come up with. While it may seem contradictive to my career, I prefer to drive older vehicles. During the summer I cruise around in a 1993 Honda Civic (EG hatch), and during the harsh Maine winters I blast around in the snow in my trusty 2000 Jeep Cherokee (XJ).

# Site Tech Stack

This site is built using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. While I'm not too familar with the Go language, I'm learning as I go (haha). I'm not the biggest fan of WordPress and prefer to run a static site since this blog doesn't need any stellar features. Most of the site is built with the classic web trio (html, css, js), and posts are written using markdown files. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good static site framework.
