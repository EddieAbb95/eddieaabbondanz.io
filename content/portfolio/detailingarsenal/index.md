Detailing Arsenal is a SaaS (software as a service) for managing and scheduling appointments for auto detailing businesses. Users can create, update, or delete appointments, along with the ability to view stats about time, services, and revenue. The app is focused towards auto detailing as the industry has some unique requirements such as vehicle check-in inspections and more that generic scheduling apps didn't offer.

## Features
- Create, update, delete appointments
- View schedule in week or daily format
- Track revenue per service
- Time management reports
- Generate custom invoices

# Why I Built It
Like Mechanic Log I built this to scratch my own itch. When running an auto detailing business as a one man show it can be difficult to track my schedule so I created a web app that could fulfill my needs. The app also has basic CRM (customer relationship management) features.

# Tech Stack
The site is built using Vue.js and the backend is an ASP.NET Core Web API. PostgreSQL is used for data persistence. Auth0 is used for user authentication.

# What Happened To It?
The app is still in development but will be deployed soon. I plan on supporting the project as long as my business is around, and plan on marketing it to other auto detailers.
