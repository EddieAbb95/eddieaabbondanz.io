Who am I?
===

Welcome! My name is Eddie Abbondanzio and this is my personal blog. I'm a software developer who loves to work on his own projects whenever possible. I've graduated with a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maine Orono, and am currently employed full time.

Hobbies
---
* Anything automotive (Detailing, Resoration, etc..)
* Software development (Full stack).
* Running
* Cooking
* Long walks on the beach... Oh wait, wrong site.

Projects
---

I always have several projects in progress. I like staying busy, and seeing what I can come up with. While it may seem contradictive to my career, I prefer to drive older vehicles. During the summer I cruise around in a 1993 Honda Civic (eg hatch), and during the harsh Maine winters I blast around in the snow in my trusty 2000 Jeep Cherokee (xj).

Site Tech Stack
===

This site is built using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. While I'm not too familar with the Go language, I'm learning as I go (haha). I'm not the biggest fan of WordPress and prefer to run a static site since this blog doesn't need any stellar features. Most of the site is built with the classic web trio (html, css, js), and posts are written using markdown files. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good static site framework.
